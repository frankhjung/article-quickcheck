# Using Randomness to Test Code

In [part 1](https://marlo.com.au/some-thoughts-on-random-number-generators/) of
this series, we explored how to generate and test (pseudo) random values. In
this article we will explore how random values can be used in testing. This is
also known as property based testing.

The first question you may be asking is: why would you use random values in
testing? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of unit testing, where known
values are tested to known responses? Well, no. Not if you think of testing the
properties of your code. Property based testing seeks to verify a large range of
applicable input values with your program code. It does this by generating a
random sample of valid input values. When generating property values, the choice
of probability distribution for random samples can be chosen to suit your use
case. If you wanted representative data then perhaps a normal distribution
suffices. Perhaps you want an even spread using a uniform distribution. Or maybe
you are testing the edges of property values then a custom distribution can be
employed.

Are you delivering solutions using micro-service or lambda functions? If so,
then property testing may well be suited to your needs.

The article is organised as follows: First we will [review](#history) where
these ideas came from, then do a short [introduction to property based
testing](#introducing-property-based-testing). This will introduce
[Generators](#generators). Next, we will briefly discuss
[Shrinkage](#shrinkage), before [finishing](#summary) with some final
observations.


## History

These concepts aren't new. Tools like [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/)
have been around since the 1960's to model text.

Kent Beck provided a unit testing framework for
[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) in 1989. Initially, tests
had to be hand crafted. It did describes a philosophy of writing and running
tests embodied by a [literate
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) test framework. 

In 1994, Richard Hamlet wrote about Random Testing. Not the "random" as in the
slang definition, meaning haphazard. Instead, Hamlet suggested that computers
could efficiently test a "vast number" of random test points. A second benefit
he identified was that random testing provided "statistical prediction of
significance in the observed results".

A few years later, in 1999, the influential paper by
[Claessen](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~koen/) and
[Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)) called,
[QuickCheck: A Lightweight Tool for Random Testing of Haskell
Programs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2449938_QuickCheck_A_Lightweight_Tool_for_Random_Testing_of_Haskell_Programs),
provided a whole new toolkit to run tests with randomised values. Their paper
was written for the functional programming language,
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), but it quickly inspired a suite of property
based testing tools in many other languages. A useful list of current
implementations appears on the
[QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) Wikipedia page.


## Introducing Property Based Testing

When testing a function or method, the idea is that any valid input should yield
a valid response. Likewise, any input outside this range should return an
appropriate failure. Compare this to how systematic tests are normally written:
Given a *specific* input, check the programs return value. And that highlights
the problem: you need to be sure you have chosen correct and *sufficient* input
values to test your code. The tools we use to check test coverage do not check
the *adequacy* of your tests. Just that you have a test for a control flow path.
So, the quality of a test is dependent upon the quality of the inputs. Property
based testing provides tools to test over randomly selected values over the
entire input range. This changes the focus of a test. When we create a
traditional unit test, we are making an assumption on an input. These
assumptions could lead to failures. Testing the properties of an input over a
large range of values can help to uncover these bugs. We have experienced this
first hand. It is a true "aha" moment!

The test values are produced using *generators*.


## Generators

Random values are produced using *generators*. These are specific functions used
to provide a random value. Some common generators are used to manufacture
Booleans, numeric types (e.g. floats, ranges of integers), characters and
strings. Both [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) and
[QuickTheories](https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories) have many
generators. And once you have a primitive generator, you can then compose these
into more elaborate generators and structures, including lists and maps. Or you
can build your own!

Apart from custom values, you may also want a custom distribution. Random
testing is most effective when the values being tested closely match the
distribution of the actual data. As the provided generators know nothing of your
data, they typically will use a uniform distribution. If something else is
required, you will need to provide your own generator. Luckily, these are not
difficult to write.


## Shrinkage

On failure, QuickCheck then reduces the selection to the minimum set. So, from a
large distribution of values, QuickCheck finds the minimal case that fails the
test. In practice, what this does is concentrate tests to the extremes of an
input value. However, this behaviour can be modified using a *Generator*.


## Summary

In this article we looked at using random values for tests. Randomness is
intrinsic to QuickCheck style test tools. Using generators you can not only
shape the distribution of test values but also customise the value types.
Recording the random seed enables you to repeat specific test runs.

Generating a large number of tests may give a false sense of security when most
of the test cases are trivial. So, choosing the correct inputs whether randomly
generated or systematically selected is important.

The QuickCheck family of test tools don't replace unit tests, rather they
augment existing tests. By thinking on properties, test cases can become more
general.
